The Secure Online Voting System is a Java-based web application that allows users to create, manage, and participate in online elections with transparency and security.

It ensures that only authorized users can conduct elections and cast votes, preventing fraud or multiple voting. The system is designed for academic institutions, organizations, and small communities that want to digitize their voting process in a simple and secure manner.
